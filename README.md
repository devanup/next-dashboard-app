### Building a Full-Stack Application with NextJS

As part of my journey to deepen my full-stack development skills, I have embarked on a new course focused on NextJS, a powerful framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

#### Project Overview

The course project involves developing a simplified financial dashboard. Here's what the application will include:

- **Public Home Page**: A welcoming entry point that is accessible to all visitors.
- **Login Page**: Secure authentication to ensure that only registered users can access the dashboard.
- **Protected Dashboard Pages**: After logging in, users will access various functionalities related to their financial data.
- **Invoice Management**: Users will have the ability to add, edit, and delete invoices, practicing CRUD operations.
- **Database Integration**: The application will be supported by a backend database, set up to handle data persistence, which will be configured in a later part of the course.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, I aim to acquire and solidify my skills in the following areas:

- Building and deploying robust full-stack applications using NextJS.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization to protect certain pages within an application.
- Managing a database that interacts with a NextJS application to store and retrieve data dynamically.

This course will serve as a stepping stone to mastering full-stack development with a focus on modern web technologies.
I'm excited to document my progress and share insights as I advance through the course chapters, facing new challenges and implementing functional components of our project.
